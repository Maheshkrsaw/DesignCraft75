# 📷 Day 113 — LensLoop LinkedIn Post

Today, I created **LensLoop**, a social photography platform inspired by Pinterest/Unsplash! 📸✨  

This project was all about **Masonry grids, smooth micro-interactions, and hover overlays** to enhance the user experience.

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Masonry Grid Layout:** CSS columns for dynamic photo arrangement  
- **Interactive Buttons:** "Follow" and "Like" buttons respond instantly with animations ❤️  
- **Download Simulation:** Fake loading effect to mimic server interaction ⏳  
- **Overlay Effects:** Hover to reveal user details and action buttons

## 🧠 Learnings
- Building **Pinterest-style layouts** using pure CSS  
- Implementing **micro-interactions** to boost UX  
- Handling **responsive design** for grids and overlays  
- Simulating **server response** for actions like download
