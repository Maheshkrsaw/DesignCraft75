# 🤖 Day 115 — BrainWave LinkedIn Post

Today, I worked on **BrainWave**, a GPT-like AI chat interface combined with **SaaS pricing UI**! 💬✨  

The project was exciting because I got to create **typewriter effects, interactive chat bubbles, and responsive pricing tables** all in one.

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Typewriter Effect:** Simulates AI typing responses ⌨️  
- **Chat UI:** Smooth user vs AI bubbles with auto-scroll  
- **Mock AI Logic:** Keyword-based responses 🤖  
- **SaaS Pricing UI:** High-conversion pricing tables with toggle switches 💰  
- Fully **responsive** for all devices
