# 🌿 Day 85 — Nature Landing Page (Fully Responsive)

Today’s task in the **Landing Page Series** was creating a clean, refreshing, and minimal **Nature-Themed Landing Page**.  
The goal was to focus on visual balance, soft color tones, and smooth responsiveness across all screen sizes.

## 🎨 Project Overview
The **Nature Landing Page** includes:
- Calm and nature-inspired **hero section**
- Feature/Info blocks with smooth spacing

This design focuses on **visual harmony + simplicity**.
