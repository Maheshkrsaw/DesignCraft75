# 🎨 Day 112 — NeonArt (NFT Marketplace) 🌐✨

Today, I built **NeonArt**, an NFT marketplace with a focus on **mobile-first design, modern UI effects, and interactive features**.  
This project strengthened my understanding of **glassmorphism design, JS file handling, and simulated wallet connections**.

---

## 🎨 What I Built
- **Mobile-First Slide-Out Sidebar** for smooth navigation  
- **Glassmorphism Cards** showcasing NFT artworks with transparency and blur  
- **File Upload Preview** using JS FileReader for instant art preview  
- **Wallet Simulation** for connecting mock MetaMask/Coinbase accounts  
- Fully **responsive layout** for mobile, tablet, and desktop  

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **HTML5** → Structure  
- **CSS3** → Glassmorphism + layout + responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** → File upload previews + wallet simulation  
- **Media Queries** → Responsive design  

---

## 📱 Responsiveness Notes
- Mobile-first approach with slide-out menu  
- Cards adjust perfectly on all screen sizes  
- Smooth transitions for hover and click events  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Implementing **glassmorphism UI** for modern designs  
- Handling **file uploads and previews** in JS  
- Designing **mobile-first layouts** with interactive menus  
- Simulating **wallet login logic** without backend
