# 🌟 Day 97 — Job Dashboard UI Project 💼✨

Today, I built a **Job Dashboard UI**, a responsive web interface that mimics real-world job listing platforms.  
This project helped me understand **card layouts, structured data display**, and **responsive design** for complex UIs.

---

## 🎨 What I Built
- **Job cards** displaying company, role, and requirements
- **Multiple card layout** for various companies (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- Clean, modern, and professional UI
- Responsive grid ensuring usability on **mobile, tablet, and desktop**

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript** (for dynamic card content)
- **Flexbox/Grid** for responsive card layout

---

## 📱 Responsiveness
- Mobile-first design  
- Cards resize and wrap smoothly  
- Clean spacing and alignment across devices  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Efficient card-based UI design  
- Maintaining consistent spacing and alignment  
- Handling responsive layouts with multiple elements  
- Realistic simulation of job dashboards
