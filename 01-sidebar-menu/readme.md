## 🧠 Overview  
After completing the **#75DaysOfFullStack** challenge, I’ve officially entered the **project-building phase** — where learning meets real-world implementation.  
Now the focus is on **HTML, CSS, JS**, and **MERN** projects to strengthen my foundation and boost design-to-code confidence. 💪

## 💻 What I Did Today  
- Started the **Project Phase** with frontend practice.  
- Created a **Responsive Sidebar Menu** using HTML, CSS, and JS.  
- Focused on responsive design, smooth transitions, and toggle animations.  
- Learned better structure and spacing for reusable design components.

## 🪞 Reflection  
> “Sharpening the edges before crafting the masterpiece.”  

Learning concepts is one part, but implementing them in **real-world projects** gives true power.  
This phase will be all about **practical application**, **creative UI design**, and **building developer intuition**.  

My plan for the next 15–20 days:  
1. 🧩 Practice 5–10 HTML/CSS/JS mini-projects  
2. ⚙️ Build 1–2 full-stack MERN applications  
3. 💬 Focus on UI/UX improvement and clean design practices

## 🎯 Key Takeaways  
- Project-based learning > Theoretical learning  
- Consistency builds momentum  
- Confidence comes through practice
