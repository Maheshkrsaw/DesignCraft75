# 🧮 Day 90 — Age Calculator App (Responsive + JS Logic Start) 🚀

Today marks the beginning of my **JavaScript Logic Practice Series**.  
I built a clean and fully responsive **Age Calculator App** that accurately calculates age based on the user’s Date of Birth.

This is my **first JS–logic project** in the #75DaysDesignFlow + #75DaysHard grind.
