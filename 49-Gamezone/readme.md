# 🎮 Day 116 — GameZone LinkedIn Post

Today, I created **GameZone**, an esports platform for live streams and tournaments! 🕹️✨  

The project was exciting because I focused on **cyberpunk aesthetics, live badges, tournament cards, and game filtering logic**.  

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Cyberpunk UI:** Neon gradients with "Orbitron" fonts 🌌  
- **Live Badges:** Pulse animations indicating active streamers 🔴  
- **Tournament Cards:** Interactive cards with dates, prize pools, and registration 🏆  
- **Game Filtering:** Sort games dynamically by genre (RPG, Shooter, Sports) 🎮  
- Fully **responsive** across devices

## 🧠 Learnings
- Creating **futuristic UI designs**  
- Animating **live status indicators**  
- Implementing **interactive filtering logic**  
- Combining multiple **interactive components** effectively
