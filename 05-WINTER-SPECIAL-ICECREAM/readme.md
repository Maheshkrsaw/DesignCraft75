# 🚀 Day 82–83 — Ice-Cream Website UI with GSAP Animations 🍨✨

These two days were dedicated to building a **modern Ice-Cream themed website** with smooth, premium-level animations using **GSAP**.  
This project helped me understand **scroll animations, timelines, triggers**, and especially how to handle **responsiveness with GSAP**.

---

## 🎨 What I Built
- Full **Ice-Cream brand UI**
- **Hero section** with smooth text animation
- **Multiple animated sections** using GSAP timelines
- **Scroll-triggered effects** that enhance user experience
- Smooth fade-ins, scaling, slide transitions & motion design

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to create **scroll-based animations** using GSAP
- How GSAP timelines work for smoother sequencing
- How animations impact overall UI experience
- Handling **responsive animations**:
  - GSAP `matchMedia()`
  - Different triggers for mobile/desktop
  - Element positioning & animation adjustments

This part was initially confusing, but slowly I understood how GSAP behaves on smaller screens.

---

## 📌 Notes
- GSAP is extremely powerful, but **requires planning** for responsiveness.
- Great project to understand **motion design** in websites.
- This project boosted my confidence in building animated UIs.
